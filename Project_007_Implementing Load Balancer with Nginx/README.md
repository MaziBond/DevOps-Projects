# Implementing Load Balancer with Nginx Project 
## Introduction
Welcome to the "Implementing Load Balancer with Nginx" project! In this project, we'll explore how to set up a load balancer using Nginx, a popular open-source web server and reverse proxy server.

### Project Goals:
- Understanding Load Balancing: Learn the concept of load balancing and its importance in distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance, reliability, and scalability.
- Nginx Configuration: Gain hands-on experience configuring Nginx as a load balancer to evenly distribute incoming HTTP requests across multiple backend servers.
- High Availability: Explore techniques for achieving high availability and fault tolerance using Nginx load balancer configurations.
- Performance Optimization: Optimize Nginx load balancer settings to enhance performance and minimize latency for clients accessing the application.
### Project Structure:
- Setup and Installation: We'll start by setting up the necessary infrastructure, including multiple backend servers and installing Nginx on a separate server to act as the load balancer.
- Nginx Configuration: We'll dive into Nginx configuration files to set up load balancing algorithms, health checks, session persistence, and other advanced features.
- Testing and Optimization: We'll conduct thorough testing to ensure the load balancer functions as expected under various traffic loads and optimize its configuration for performance and reliability.
- Monitoring and Maintenance: We'll explore monitoring tools and techniques to monitor the health and performance of the load balancer and backend servers, as well as strategies for ongoing maintenance and updates.
### Prerequisites:
1. Basic understanding of Linux system administration.
2. Familiarity with web servers and HTTP protocol.
3. Access to multiple servers or virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2 instances, DigitalOcean droplets) for setting up backend servers.
4. A dedicated server or virtual machine to install and configure Nginx as the load balancer.
Let's Get Started!


## 1. Setup and Installation:
### Understanding Load Balancing:
Load balancing is crucial for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and availability of applications.

Infrastructure Setup: Begin by setting up the necessary infrastructure for the project. This may involve provisioning multiple backend servers to host your application, as well as a dedicated server or virtual machine to install and configure Nginx as the load balancer.
- We will set-up two backend servers. For this purpose, We will deploy two EC2 instances.
